# Alien Invasion Game

{% include feature_row %}

This game is based upon the Space Invader arcade game.

## Coding Reflections

- Originally coded this game following the chapters from *Python Crash Course,
2nd Edition* by Eric Matthes.
- Refactored it to implement a Model, View, Controller design pattern.
- Refactoring proved complicated due to the mixing of model, view, and controller logic in the original implementation.
