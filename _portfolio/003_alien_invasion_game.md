# Alien Invasion Game

{% include feature_row %}

This game is based upon the Space Invader arcade game.

## History of Development

I coded this game following the chapters from *Python Crash Course,
2nd Edition* by Eric Matthes.

I then refactored it to implement a Model, View, Controller design pattern.
