I want to use my abilities and passion in a tech company doing meaningful work to help them change the world and serve their customers/users. I am a quick learner, work well in teams, and want to change my little part of the world to make it all it can be.

My first introduction to computer programming was in high school (learned Machine Language, Assembly Language, and Basic). These first years sparked my interest in computers and technology and spurred me to begin studies in electrical engineering (learned Fortran). These university years improved my math and engineering skills.

At this point I felt a call to ministry. I grew in values, integrity, communication skills, and leadership. During these years my interest in computers and technology continued (purchased used personal computers and ran Linux on them to make file, print, and email servers, and turned one into a wireless router).

Recently, I retired from ministry and again have returned to my love of computers and coding. I'm self-taught in Python, and Django. I am expanding the breadth of my learning with design patterns, algorithms, clean coding, pragmatic programming, and other topics (also familiar with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and currently learning Java).

Skills:
* Python, Django, Git, GitHub
* Life-long love of coding/computers/technology
* Constantly growing and learning
* Team player
* Excellent communication skills
