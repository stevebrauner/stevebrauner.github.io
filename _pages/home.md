I was first introduced to computer programming in high school in Salem, Oregon. I started programming on a mini-frame unix based computer at my school in the early 1980's.

My first programming language was machine language, learning to manipulate registers, and file writes at that basic level. Machine language was challenging in seeing in the 1 and 0's what operations were being made.

Next we upgraded to assembly language. The three-letter commands were easier to understand and offered slightly more capabilities than machine language.

I ended my high school years learning basic (yes, that primitive language). In comparison to machine or assembly language it was a pleasure to code in a language that read like English.

These first years sparked my interest in computers and technology and spurred me to consider going into electrical engineering studies in my university years. In these first years I learned Fortran and improved my math, physics, and engineering skills.

At this point I felt a call to ministry and have been in that career path for over 20 years now. During this time I have grown in values, integrity, communication skills (including public speaking), and leadership.

During these many years I still had interest in computers and technology. I would purchase used personal computers and run linux to make, file, print, and email servers, even turning one into a wireless router. Later, I extended Emacs by learning and programming it in Lisp.

Recently I have retired from ministry and again have returned to my love of computers. I'm self-taught in Python. I have used Django, PySide6, Pytest, Click, Plotly, and other libraries to write for fun, and the projects on my portfolio.

Expanding the breadth of my learning, I studied design patterns, algorithms, clean coding, pragmatic programming, and other topics.

Also, I am familiar with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. I'm currently learning Java to expand my abilities.
